Puts up a small window with four numbers: how many healers and how many total
players your side has in your scenario or city siege instance, and how many
healers and total players the enemy has. Green numbers represent
your side, and red represents the enemy. The first number is the count of
healers, and the second is the total count.

Usage is simple:

    /scbal on
        Turn it on. When you enter a scenario, the window will show and the
        counts will be updated. When you leave the scenario, the window will
        go away.

    /scbal off
        Turn it off. The window will not be shown.

    /scbal
        Same as "/scbal on"

    /scbal test
        Toggles test mode. In test mode, the window is shown even if you
        are not in a scenario. You can use this to move the window around
        so you don't have to waste time in your next scenario screwing
        around with the window position.
        
The window is initially placed just to the left of the map filters button.
You can drag it elsewhere if you wish, and the position will be saved.

You can also use the layout editor to change its position, or to change
the opacity.
