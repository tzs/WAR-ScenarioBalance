Puts up a small window that shows how many people are in your scenario or
city instance, and how many of them are healers, RDPS, MDPS, and tanks,
for each side. Green numbers are your side, red numbers are the enemy.

For each side, the display is formatted like this:

    12 = 4 + 2 + 1 + 5

The first number is the total number of players. That's followed
by the counts of healers, RDPS, MDPS, and tanks in that order.

Usage is simple:

    /scbal on
        Turn it on. When you enter a scenario, the window will show and the
        counts will be updated. When you leave the scenario, the window will
        go away.

    /scbal off
        Turn it off. The window will not be shown.

    /scbal
        Same as "/scbal on"

    /scbal test
        Toggles test mode. In test mode, the window is shown even if you
        are not in a scenario. You can use this to move the window around
        so you don't have to waste time in your next scenario screwing
        around with the window position. There will be sample numbers
        shown.
        
The window is initially placed just to the left of the map filters button.
You can drag it elsewhere if you wish, and the position will be saved.

You can also use the layout editor to change its position, or to change
the opacity.
